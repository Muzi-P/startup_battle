# Startup Battle

The app we will build today is called The Ultimate Startup Battle Ground. Several startups are springing up all over the world. These startups are coming up with innovative technology but have limited funds. Our app hopes to alleviate the issue of funding by providing an up-to-date list of startup battles all over the world with details of sponsors and seed fund amount. The Ultimate Startup Battle Ground app will display a list of startup battles to the general public.

Interested startup founders can get hold of this list and ensure their team does not miss out on it. However, the app will also provide a list of secret startup battles. This list will only be accessible to registered members.
